## 🎨 Visual Design Philosophy

### Design Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Start simple (Quick Setup)
   - Expand to intermediate (Common settings)
   - Deep dive if needed (Advanced/JSON)

2. **Contextual Help**
   - Tooltips appear inline, not separate page
   - Recommendations show when relevant
   - Examples use real values

3. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Impact levels color-coded (Green/Amber/Red)
   - Priorities clear (High/Medium/Low)
   - Actions prominent (Apply buttons)

4. **Feedback Loops**
   - Immediate validation
   - Impact preview
   - Success/error states

### Color System

- **Blue**: Optimization (positive)
- **Amber**: Warning (cautionary)
- **Purple**: Suggestion (optional)
- **Green**: Conservative/Safe
- **Red**: High impact/risk

## 💬 Key Decisions Made (Product Manager Perspective)

### 1. Why Merge Config + Policy?
**Decision**: Single "Settings" tab instead of two

**Reasoning**:
- Users confused by separation
- Settings are interdependent
- Industry standard (Slack, GitHub, etc.)
- Reduces cognitive load

### 2. Why AI Tooltips?
**Decision**: Contextual help instead of separate documentation

**Reasoning**:
- Users won't read external docs
- Help exactly where needed
- Learn by doing, not reading
- Reduces support burden

### 3. Why Smart Recommendations?
**Decision**: Proactive suggestions vs passive validation

**Reasoning**:
- Users don't know what they don't know
- Prevents misconfiguration
- Educates while configuring
- Builds confidence

### 4. Why Preset Profiles?
**Decision**: 3 presets (Conservative/Balanced/Aggressive)

**Reasoning**:
- 3 is proven optimal (not too many, not too few)
- Covers 90% of use cases
- Easy to understand
- Quick start for beginners

### 5. Why This Information Architecture?
**Decision**: Universe → Strategy → Risk → Advanced

**Reasoning**:
- Logical flow (what → how → safety → expert)
- Progressive disclosure
- Matches mental model
- Reduces overwhelm

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The redesign will be considered successful when:

### Quantitative
- ✅ 70%+ users use presets (beginner adoption)
- ✅ 40%+ customize after preset (engagement)
- ✅ 60%- reduction in support tickets
- ✅ 4.5/5 user satisfaction
- ✅ 25%+ improvement in trading performance

### Qualitative
- ✅ Users say "This is so much clearer"
